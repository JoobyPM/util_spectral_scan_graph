## Install the app
Install latest nodejs:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/
or
https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/

Then clone project
`git clone https://github.com/JoobyPM/util_spectral_scan_graph/`

To run the app:
`node index.js`

By default, it runs on 8082, if you need to run on another port use env, e.g.`HTTP_PORT=8083`


Put `.csv` files (generated by Gateway util) to source folder.

Get into the chart on the web page:
`http://localhost:8082`


## Get.sh
There is a bit of bash automation, that helps generate and download the scan.
To use it:
1) Change `IP` address of Gateway in `get.sh` and run it.
2) It will request from GW scan and download it to source folder.
3) Enter the password or if you have ssh keys on GW, it goes in silent mode
